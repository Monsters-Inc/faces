# Historical Faces  
Classifying Age and Gender on Historical Photographs using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Background
This project intends to classify faces in historical photographs into age and gender. The goal is to develop an algorithm specialized on classifying historical images, as well as an interface where users can insert pictures for analysis. This project aims to facilitate historical research by contributing with new tools for image analysis. The algorithm is developed in the programming language Python and uses Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) to classify age and gender. The user interface is developed in the JavaScript framework React.js and communicates
with the Python algorithm via a Node.js server.
